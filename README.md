Creation of Digital MRI Phantoms


A digital MRI phantom represents a set of various tissue characteristics, such as T1 and T2 relaxation times and proton density. Digital phantoms simulate the properties and behavior of different tissues during an MRI procedure. They are an essential tool for developers and researchers in the field of MRI, allowing them to test and optimize imaging techniques, pulse sequences, and reconstruction algorithms without the need for physical phantoms, volunteer scanning, or actual MRI procedures.
